The purpose of this homework assignment is to create a day planner for the hours of 9AM-5PM that saves users input to local storage and changes colors based on local time. 
After many hours of testing and trying I did finally manage to find a way to get all of those functions to work for me. I managed to set up function to compare the timed rows to the current time and to get the colors to change appropriately. I also managed to set what ever the user puts into the calander event section for each time to save to local storage and get retrieved even when the page has been refreshed. I am very happy with the way this turned out!
